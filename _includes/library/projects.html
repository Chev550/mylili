	<p>This research evaluated the performance of the building integrated solar thermal shading system in terms of energy saving, daylight provision, and solar usage based on a medium office building in Los Angeles. Annual dynamic simulations were conducted to predict the year-round impacts of the BISTS system to the building.</p>
