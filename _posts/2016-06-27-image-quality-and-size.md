Together, image quality and size determine how much space each photograph occupies on the memory card.

### Image Quality

Image quality can be set by pressing the ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/journals/img_8.png)__(QUAL)__ button and rotating the main command dial. The camera supports the following image quality options:

* __NEF (RAW)__[^nef] Raw 12-bit data from the image sensor are saved directly to the memory card. JPEG copies of NEF (RAW) images can be created using the __NEF (RAW) processing__ option in the retouch menu or software such as ViewNX or Capture NX 2.
* __JPEG fine__ Recorded JPEG images at a compression ratio of roughly <mark>1:4</mark> (fine image quality).
* __JPEG normal__ (default) Recorded JPEG images at a compression ratio of roughly <mark>1:8</mark> (normal quality).
* __JPEG basic__ Recorded JPEG images at a compression ratio of roughly <mark>1:16</mark> (basic image quality).
* __NEF (RAW) + JPEG fine__ Two images are recorded: one NEF (RAW) image and one fine-quality JPEG image.
* __NEF (RAW) + JPEG normal__ Two images are recorded: one NEF (RAW) image and one normal-quality JPEG image.
* __NEF (RAW) + JPEG basic__ Two images are recorded: one NEF (RAW) image and one basic-quality JPEG image.

### Image Size

Image size is measured in pixels. The following options are available.

<table class="center">
	<tr>
		<th>Image size</th>
		<th>Size (pixels)</th>
		<th>Approximate size when printed at 200 dpi</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>L</strong> (default)</td>
		<td>4,288 x 2,848</td>
		<td>54.5 x 36.2 cm (21.4 x 14.2 in.)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>M</strong></td>
		<td>3,216 x 2,136</td>
		<td>40.8 x 27.1 cm (16.1 x 10.7 in.)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>S</strong></td>
		<td>2,144 x 1,424</td>
		<td>27.2 x 18.1 cm (10.7 x 7.1 in.)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Image size can be set by pressing the ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/journals/img_8.png)__(QUAL)__ button and rotating the sub-command dial. Note that the option selected for image size does not affect the size of NEF (RAW) images. When viewed on a computer, NEF images are 4,288 x 2,848 pixels in size.

[^nef]: __Nikon Electronic Format (NEF)__ is Nikon's RAW file format, which contains all the image information captured by the camera's sensor, along with the image's metadata. The NEF file is written to the memory card in an <mark>uncompressed</mark> form. The primary benefit of NEF is that no in-camera processing for white balance, hue, tone and sharpening are applied; rather, those values are retained as instruction sets included in the file. You can change the instruction set as many times as you like without ever disturbing the original image's RAW data. Another benefit of NEF file is that it retains 12-bit (or 14-bit) data, resulting in an image with a far greater tonal range than an 8-bit JPEG or TIFF file.
