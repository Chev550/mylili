#### Requirements to earn the LEED AP credit

> Each rating system awards points for having one LEED AP as a principal on a project. That means you canâ€™t have a part-time LEED AP or someone who only focuses in one area of the project.

__What credit can you earn by having a LEED AP on a project?__

The rating systems allow one Innovation Design (ID) point for having a LEED AP on staff.

__What does the LEED AP do?__

LEED APs help streamline the application and certification process. The LEED AP must be involved in a substantial capacity on the project. A LEED AP will understand the requirements of the rating system and be able to promote the whole building approach to achieving LEED as well as encourage the team members to work together on an integrative process or management plan.

__Who can be a LEED AP?__

LEED Accredited Professionals are experienced building industry practitioners who have demonstrated their knowledge of integrative process and their capacity to facilitate the LEED certification process on the LEED Accredited Professional exam.
