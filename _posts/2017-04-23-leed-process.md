#### Organization fundamentals

> Know the purpose of USGBC and what its goals are.

__What is the mission of USGBC?__

USGBC’s mission is “to transform the way buildings and communities are designed, built, and operated, enabling an environmentally and socially responsible, healthy, and prosperous environment that improves the quality of life”.

__What roles does GBCI perform?__

#### Structure of the LEED rating systems

> Understand what credit categories are, prerequisites, credits, and minimum program requirements.

__What is the difference between a prerequisite and a credit?__

The term “prerequisite” refers to a mandatory project characteristic, measurement, quality, value or function as identified within the LEED rating system. Prerequisites represent the key criteria that define green building performance. Each project must satisfy all specified prerequisites outlined in the LEED rating system under which it is registered.

The phrase “Credit” means a non-mandatory project characteristic, measurement, quality, value or function as identified within a LEED rating system. Credits represent particular facets of sustainable design that contribute to overall green building performance. No single credit is mandatory; credits are selected and pursued at the option of a LEED project team.

__How many points do prerequisites earn?__

Prerequisites do not earn your project any points because they are required for the project to be considered.

__What are Minimum Program Requirements?__

Projects must comply with the Minimum Program Requirements (MPRs). MPRs help define what types of buildings the rating systems are used to evaluate. All projects must:

- Must be in a permanent location on existing land
- Must use a reasonable LEED boundaries
- Must comply with project size requirements

Projects that do not comply with the MPRs may have their certification revoked.

__What is the difference between a prerequisite and a MPR?__

__What is Regional Priority used for?__

The intent of the regional priority credits and points is to encourage teams to attempt LEED credits that address specific environmental priorities in the project’s region.

__What is the minimum number of points a project must earn for certification?__

The ‘greenness’ of a LEED project is based on a 100 point scale with an additional 10 bonus points. There are four levels of LEED certification:

- Certified: 40-49 points
- Silver: 50-59 points
- Gold: 60-79 points
- Platinum: 80+ points

#### Scope of each LEED rating system

> Select which rating system would be appropriate for a given project description. The residential project types are important to know because the rating system you use depends on the height of the project.

__What rating system should be used for a tenant space?__

_LEED BD+C: Hospitality_ is dedicated to hotels, motels, inns, or other businesses within the service industry that provide transitional or short-term lodging with or without food.

__What rating system would be best for a 3-story residential building?__

_LEED BD+C: Homes and Multifamily Lowrise_ is for single-family homes and multi- family residential buildings of 1 to 3 stories.

#### LEED development process

> This section makes sure you understand how LEED is developed and by whom, as well as how LEED is updated and changes over time.

__Who approves the LEED rating systems?__

LEED was developed by USGBC, and the LEED Green Building Rating System is the USGBC's primary vehicle for promoting sustainable design and construction. The LEED standard was created through volunteer committees.

__What makes LEED transparent?__

A consensus process that has a balanced and transparent committee structure.

__How often is addenda published?__

---

#### Impact categories

> Make sure you read the overview of the LEED v4 impact category and point allocation process.

__How are credit points determined?__

__How do credit weightings evolve?__

The points are weighted to best address the social, environmental, and economic outcomes identified by USGBC. LEED credits have different weightings depending on their ability to impact different environmental and human health concerns. More points are awarded for those credits that have a greater impact.

__What are the LEED impact categories?__

The LEED impact categories answer the question: “What should a LEED project accomplish?”

- Reverse Contribution to Global Climate Change
- Enhance Individual Human Health and Well-Being
- Protect and Restore Water Resources
- Protect, Enhance and Restore Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
- Promote Sustainable and Regenerative Material Resources Cycles
- Build a Greener Economy
- Enhance Social Equity, Environmental Justice, and Community Quality of Life

#### LEED certification process

> For this objective you need to know the tools and components used when working on a LEED project.

__What is LEED Online used for?__

LEED Online is a central repository for all project information. This tool allows team members to:

- Submit all documentation online
- Update credit templates
- View and submit Credit Interpretation Requests (CIRs)
- Contact customer service
- View and respond to reviewer comments

__How do you register a project?__

Projects are registered online at leedonline.com.

__What is a LEED Scorecard?__

The score card (also called the LEED checklist) lists all of the credits for the specific rating system and helps the project team track which ones are ideal for the project to attempt and those that are ‘maybes’ and need to be further investigated.

__When is the LEED Scorecard used?__

The LEED score card is a critical component early on in the LEED integrative process.

__What does the LEED reviewer do?__

Combined review:

- Preliminary review
- Final review

Split review:

- Preliminary design phase review
- Final design-phase review
- Preliminary construction-phase review
- Final construction-phase review

__What is a CIR?__

Credit Interpretation Requests and Rulings (referred to as “CIRs”) are used to clarify a single question the project team may have and can be submitted any time after project registration.

#### Other rating systems

> Know what other rating systems are out there and how they compare or complement LEED.

__What is the International Green Construction Code?__

International Green Construction Code (IgCC) provides model code language to establish baseline regulations for new and existing buildings related to energy conservation, water efficiency, building owner responsibilities, site impacts, building waste, and materials and other considerations. The IgCC model code language becomes law when it is adopted by the appropriate state or local authority charged with governing construction.

__What is ASHRAE 189.1?__

---

#### Requirements to earn the LEED AP credit

> Each rating system awards points for having one LEED AP as a principal on a project. That means you can’t have a part-time LEED AP or someone who only focuses in one area of the project.

__What credit can you earn by having a LEED AP on a project?__

The rating systems allow one Innovation Design (ID) point for having a LEED AP on staff.

__What does the LEED AP do?__

LEED APs help streamline the application and certification process. The LEED AP must be involved in a substantial capacity on the project. A LEED AP will understand the requirements of the rating system and be able to promote the whole building approach to achieving LEED as well as encourage the team members to work together on an integrative process or management plan.

__Who can be a LEED AP?__

LEED Accredited Professionals are experienced building industry practitioners who have demonstrated their knowledge of integrative process and their capacity to facilitate the LEED certification process on the LEED Accredited Professional exam.
