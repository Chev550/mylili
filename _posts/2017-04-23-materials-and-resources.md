__What is an environmental product declaration (EPD)?__

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) is a standardized way of quantifying the environmental impact of a product or system. Typically, an EPD will include information about a product’s impact on global warming, ozone depletion, water pollution, ozone creation, and greenhouse gas emissions. An EPD can also include other impacts that are of particular interest to the discloser, such as human toxicity risk and corporate social responsibility.

__What information is included in a health product declaration (HPD)?__

Health Product Declaration (HPDs) provide a full disclosure of the potential chemicals of concern in products by comparing product ingredients to a wide variety of “hazard” lists published by government authorities and scientific associations. The HPD itself does not indicate if a product is healthy - it merely reports on the material ingredients.

HPD is a format for reporting product contents and health information about products and materials. EPDs include information not in HPDs such as: the environmental impact of raw material acquisition, energy use and efficiency, emissions to air, soil and water and waste generation.
