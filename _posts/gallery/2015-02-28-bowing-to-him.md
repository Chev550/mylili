There are times in life when we face trials and tribulations that are seemingly overwhelming. At these times we cannot find a way to deal with our situation. We feel hopeless. We are at our proverbial ropeâ€™s end. At these times, we have only one choice: to realize that God is always there for us. And, sometimes He shows us the way with such power and strength, striking us with emotions that literally bring us to our knees, bowing to Him in desperation, and ultimately, thankfulness.
