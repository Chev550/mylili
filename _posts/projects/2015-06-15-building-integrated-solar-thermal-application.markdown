Building integrated solar thermal shading (BISTS) system is a new type of solar thermal application that potentially replaces traditional building exterior shading devices with small-sized solar thermal collectors for thermal heat generation, solar gain reduction, and glare protection. This research evaluated the performance of the BISTS system based on a medium office building in Los Angeles (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>), thus to help streamline the product design and system configuration.

#### BISTS configuration

The BISTS louvers are assumed to be installed horizontally on the south facade and vertically on the east and west facades (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>). Parametric study has been conducted to propose a final BISTS design, in which the total BISTS depth _d_, the height above the window _h_, the shading-to-window ratio _r_, and the slat angle _θ_ were discussed and determined by leveraging building energy consumption and daylight provision. Various _d-h-θ_ and _r-θ_ combinations were investigated.

Case `d0.84_h0.66_θ30◦` was selected for the south facade, which consists of 4 horizontal panel arrays on each strip window with 30◦ surface slope. The total depth of the BISTS was 0.84 m and it was located 0.66 m above the window. Case `r1.28_θ0◦` was used for both east and west facades, in which 8 panels are symmetrically mounted in vertical arrays with 0◦ slat angle on each strip window. The total collector area is about 460 m2.

#### Energy saving

The BISTS system helps to reduce the building energy consumption. The savings vary for different BISTS configurations. Potentially, 1.4% of primary energy saving can be obtained due to the south horizontal BISTS installation. 1.8% and 2.1% of energy savings can be achieved from the east and west vertical BISTS installations, respectively. The savings are not significant because for a large-scale building, energy consumption is mainly dominated by interior loads instead of weather condition. The final proposed design could save 5.3% of the total primary energy.

#### Daylight provision

The BISTS system improves the interior useful daylight level and reduces the excessive daylight level for a single perimeter room. However, some vertical cases with high shading-to-window ratios and large slat angles cannot benefit the useful daylight, which should be avoided for applications. The BISTS system also changes the illuminance distribution on the work plane, especially for the east and west installations. The final proposed design could increase the _UDI500–1000_ value by 2.1% (south), 28.5% (east), and 21.6% (west), and reduce the _UDI>2000_ value by 5.8% (south), 26.1% (east), and 27.0% (west).

#### Solar usage

The BISTS system can be employed to provide domestic hot water (DHW), space heating and/or cooling. To achieve the economic optimum solar fraction of 75% for DWH, either 10 m2 collector on the south facade or 33 m2 collector on the east and west facades are required. The second scenario was proved to be more appealing, in which 64.6% of heating demand or 20.2% of cooling requirement can be potentially met by the remaining collectors. During June and October, heating demand can be fully covered. But for cooling load, the highest solar fraction is only about 35% in April.
