<p>Hey dude,</p>

<p>Sorry to bother but I do need a clarification from you to avoid further misunderstanding. I thought I got a clear answer last time, which is indicative enough for me to dislike you and ignore you. That’s actually what I have been doing until recently you came back to my life. I was struggling if I should keep ignoring you as a stranger, or chat with you like an acquaintance. Finally, I said hi. It seems you’re still interested in becoming my friend. But I really concern about how far our friendship can go. Most likely it will fade out soon and end up with silence and indifference. And I understand, without interactions, most relationships die out that way.</p>

<p>I’m writing you not because I’m afraid to lose a friend. Since our first talk, you have said a lot of confusing and sensitive words to me, which are far beyond the scope of a common friendship. You intensively wrote me messages for a while, then completely disappeared. You made promises but never fulfill them. I had no idea whether I was dealing with an admirer or a creep/fraud. I guess that’s why we couldn’t well communicate and understand each other. When I confirmed with you whether you’re being dishonorable or after me as your boyfriend, you denied both, which brought me more confusion and disgust. Afterwards, I decided to leave you alone, and no longer treat you as a friend.</p>

<p>Somehow I feel guilty to do that because I very much appreciate your kindness and gentleness. Many words you said to me, if I take them correctly and positively, are very encouraging and caring. I never want to disappoint or hurt anyone who cares and supports me. And I’m afraid to put an innocent on my blacklist due to misunderstanding. I’m struggling.</p>

<p>Please, Chad, if you have a minute, tell me how I should treat you. What are your expectations, and what is your true purpose of saying those confusing and tricky words? I’m seeking a clear response to sweep away my suspicion.</p>

<p>Sorry about this long letter. In case we no longer meet, these might be the last words I’d love to share with you before our connection fades away.</p>

<p>Take care,</p>

<p>Lucas</p>
